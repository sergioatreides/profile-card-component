## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

The part that, curiously, has taken me the most work has been to handle the two images in the background and make them look correctly in the browser.

I am not entirely happy with the result and I think there are surely better ways to solve the problem.
